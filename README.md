# Simple Switch Tester
The Simple Switch Tester is a cost effective, open source assistive technology for testing assistive switches. When an assistive switch is connected to the tester via the 3.5 mm jack and activated, a light on the tester will illuminate indicating that the switch is functioning correctly. The tester is powered by two AAA batteries. A test button on the side of the tester allows the batteries to be tested to confirm the tester is working correctly before testing a switch.

The Simple Switch Tester is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials is about $8 (plus $8 for component shipping).

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/SST_BOM_v0.1.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Simple Switch Tester. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. For convenience, you can use this Digikey cart: https://www.digikey.ca/short/w37qmwmv



### 2. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components for the switch tester case and choose an option for the case.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Switch Tester

Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/SST_Assembly_Guide_v0.1.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion. There is also a build video available at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHm8Z5UD4Sw
